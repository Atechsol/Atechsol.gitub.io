Personal Website (index.html)
This file contains the code for the main page of a personal website. It is built using HTML and is intended to be a starting point for further customization.

Features:

Placeholder content for various sections such as:
Header: Your name and profession (or tagline).
About Me: A brief introduction about yourself.
Skills: List of your skills and relevant technologies.
Projects: Showcase your projects with optional links.
Contact: Your contact information (email, social media links).
Placeholder images and styles for demonstration purposes.
Customization:

Replace the placeholder content with your own information and personalize the website to reflect your unique style.
Modify the HTML code to add new sections or functionality.
Use CSS to style the website according to your preferences.
Additional Notes:

This is a basic setup and can be extended to include multiple pages for different sections of your website (e.g., about, projects, contact).
Consider using frameworks like Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS for easier layout and styling.
Explore tools like online code editors and web servers to develop and test your website locally before deploying it online.
